## Development Details & Time Taken

This project was designed, developed, and deployed in just **2 and a half days**. All core features‚Äîincluding user and pharmacy flows, Supabase integration, file uploads, quotations, dashboards, and email notifications‚Äîwere implemented within this rapid timeframe.

The app features robust **role-based access control (RBAC)** and **Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)** policies to ensure data privacy and secure separation between user and pharmacy roles. This means users and pharmacies only see and interact with the data relevant to their role, with all access enforced at the database level.

This demonstrates the power of modern full-stack tools and a focused workflow.

Feel free to explore both user and pharmacy flows. If you have any questions or issues, please open an issue or contact the maintainer.
